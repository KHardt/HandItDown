The purpose of this application is to prevent purchase duplication of your child's items by listing what your child has,
but also what your child needs (wishlist) as well as a list of items to be donated. 


To run this application you will need to clone the project from github and then run the sln project in visual studio. 
You can then enter items from your child's inventory by using the create function. There are categories for toys, clothing, 
books, and misc section which can be anything not appropriate for the other categories. There is also separate categories 
for items that are being donated and needed (wishlist). In the event that items must be split i.e. keeping 10 matchbox
cars but giving away 10 others, it is recommended to create an additional entry and change the status. 

v2 of this application will allow other family members to view your inventory as well you being able to view theirs. 
This will allow family members to claim items you are donating as well as see what items your child needs for events such
as birthday and Christmas via the wishlist. 
V2 will also not include a general inventory but instead focus solely on the needs list and wishlist allowing a match search.
This will act as a registry for gift giving events as well as a claiming process for items to be donated.
